//     submitting a review. Both are reversible, and both can unblock a merge
//     the gate exists to hold, so an agent doing them takes part in a control
//     it is meant to be subject to.
//
// The second reason is easy to miss. Reversibility alone once let review
// submission through as "like commenting", when APPROVED is precisely the input
// a required-reviewer check consumes.
//
// Creating things is generally safe even where this package offers no way to
// undo it: opening a pull request or tagging a commit changes no branch and
// gates nothing. Judge by consequence, not by whether a delete tool exists.

// its declared schema does not describe. Out is also what populates
// structuredContent, with the JSON serialisation of the same value used as the
// text content when the handler does not set one.
//
// Every Out in this package is a named struct with a single collection or
// object field, so structuredContent is always a JSON object. Clients that
// validate results against a pre-SEP-2106 revision of the spec reject a bare
// array with "expected record, received array"; naming the payload avoids that
