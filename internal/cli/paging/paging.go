// Package paging owns the --limit and --all flags shared by every list command.
//
// It exists because those flags were registered 32 times by hand and described
// 21 different ways, most of them as a "page size". That was wrong twice over.
// The value is a cap on results, not on requests. And a page is not something a
// CLI caller can navigate: there is no cursor to advance, so a "page size" names
// an HTTP detail the services already handle rather than anything the caller can
// act on. See ADR-074.

// Truncating a result set a service already capped is a no-op, so this does not
// require knowing which semantic the backing service uses -- which is the

//
// It does require that the slice is what the command renders. `pr comment list`
// groups its comments into threads and renders those, so capping the comments
// would drop replies out of the middle of a thread rather than shortening the
// list; a command like that has to cap the unit it displays, or not at all.
