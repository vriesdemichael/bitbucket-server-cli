// TestCommitListJira is gone rather than moved. Reaching a non-empty answer
// needs a Jira linked to Bitbucket, which this stack has not got, so the
// payload had to be written here -- and what it then asserted was that the
// commit renderer prints a commit, which every other `commit list` in the
// live suite already asks of real ones. The one thing that was particular to
// this endpoint, unwrapping toCommit, is asserted where it happens, in
// internal/services/jira.
