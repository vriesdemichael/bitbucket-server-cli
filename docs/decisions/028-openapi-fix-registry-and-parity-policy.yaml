title: OpenAPI fix registry and parity enforcement
category: development
status: accepted
decision: >
  Maintain a dedicated YAML registry at docs/openapi/fixes.yaml for every workaround,
  sanitizer rule, post-generation fix, or runtime/test adaptation needed on top of
  Atlassian's vendored OpenAPI artifact to produce usable generated models/endpoints.
  Each registry entry must include description, reference, detailed change notes, and
  executable verification commands.
  OpenAPI-derived behavior is considered trustworthy only when covered by seeded live
  parity tests that exercise non-empty flows.
agent_instructions: >
  Whenever you add or modify any OpenAPI-related fix (spec sanitation, generation patch,
  adapter behavior, or compatibility test), update docs/openapi/fixes.yaml in the same change.
  Do not rely on empty-list parity tests for contract confidence; prefer seeded live tests that
  create and verify real entities.
  If a fix is removed because upstream spec/tooling improved, remove or update the registry
  entry and include verification evidence in the change.
rationale: >
  Generated code depends on both upstream spec quality and generator behavior.
  Without explicit fix logging, compatibility knowledge becomes tribal and regressions are hard
  to diagnose.
  A structured fix registry plus seeded parity tests creates an auditable trail and a repeatable
  trust model for future endpoint expansion.
rejected_alternatives:
  - alternative: Keep OpenAPI fixes only in commit history
    reason: Hard to discover, weak for onboarding, and poor at enforcing ongoing hygiene.
  - alternative: Treat generated output as self-documenting
    reason: Generated code shows final state but not why deviations or sanitizers were needed.
  - alternative: Use parity tests without data seeding
    reason: Empty-state checks can pass while failing to prove real contract behavior.
