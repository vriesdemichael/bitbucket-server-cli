title: AI agents as first-class developers
category: development
status: accepted
decision: >
  Development-critical knowledge must be stored in AI-discoverable locations such as
  AGENTS.md, decision records, architecture docs, and focused inline rationale comments.
  AI agents are treated as first-class contributors and must be able to onboard from
  repository artifacts without tribal knowledge.
agent_instructions: |
  Always document important standards and assumptions in discoverable project files.
  Do not rely on implicit conventions. When you find recurring but undocumented patterns,
  propose adding or updating a decision record or AGENTS.md guidance.

  ADR content placement:
  - Use `agent_instructions` for information an agent must know before modifying areas.
  - Use `decision` and `rationale` for architectural context and trade-offs.
  - Keep instructions concise and actionable to reduce context noise.
rationale: >
  High-quality AI collaboration requires the same contextual access humans need.
  Explicit, structured documentation reduces ambiguity, speeds onboarding, and keeps
  implementation decisions consistent across sessions and contributors.
rejected_alternatives:
  - alternative: Depend mainly on code comments for project conventions
    reason: Comments are distributed and rarely capture cross-cutting workflow or architecture policy.
  - alternative: Assume agents infer conventions from existing code
    reason: Inference is slower, inconsistent, and increases drift in implementation style.
