title: PR readiness and auto-merge criteria
category: development
status: accepted
decision: >
  A PR is ready to open only when code is fully reviewable and local quality gates pass.
  A PR is ready for auto-merge when review feedback is addressed, required checks pass,
  and user approval/review is complete.
agent_instructions: >
  Before opening a PR, run repository checks (task quality:check and relevant live tests),
  ensure no partial implementations, and remove TODO/FIXME/debug leftovers.
  Ask user confirmation before opening a PR.
  Before enabling auto-merge, ensure comments are resolved and required checks are green.
  Use rebase auto-merge when appropriate.
rationale: >
  Strict readiness criteria reduce review churn and prevent low-signal PR cycles.
  Rebase auto-merge preserves linear history while keeping review completion explicit.
