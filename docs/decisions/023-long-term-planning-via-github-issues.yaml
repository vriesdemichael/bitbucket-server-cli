title: Long-term planning via GitHub issues
category: development
status: accepted
decision: >
  All planning that exceeds the scope of a single branch or agent session is tracked
  through GitHub issues. Issues are the source of truth for feature requests, multi-step
  epics, known bugs, and technical debt.
agent_instructions: >
  For work spanning multiple sessions or branches, create or reference a GitHub issue.
  Use issue checklists or linked sub-issues for large efforts.
  Reference resolved issues in commit messages when appropriate (for example: closes #42).
  Do not keep long-term plans only in local notes or transient chat context.
  At the start of a session, review open issues to rehydrate project priorities.
rationale: >
  Agent sessions are ephemeral and local scratch context is not a durable planning system.
  GitHub issues provide a shared, searchable, and reviewable project memory that supports
  coordination between humans and agents over time.
rejected_alternatives:
  - alternative: Track long-term plans in local files only
    reason: Poor visibility, weak collaboration, and high risk of plan drift across sessions.
  - alternative: Rely on conversational context for planning continuity
    reason: Session context is temporary and not reliable as a project source of truth.
