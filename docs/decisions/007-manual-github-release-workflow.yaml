title: Manual GitHub release workflow
category: development
status: accepted
decision: >
  Use a manually triggered GitHub Actions release workflow for tagging, changelog generation,
  and publishing release artifacts. Do not auto-release on every push.
agent_instructions: >
  Design release automation around workflow_dispatch and commit-history-based changelog generation.
  Ensure release notes and versioning are derived from Conventional Commits.
  Keep normal development local-first and reserve CI release automation for explicit release actions.
rationale: >
  Manual release triggering reduces accidental releases while preserving reproducibility.
  It also aligns with local-first development where contributors run checks locally but still need a
  reliable, repeatable release process with auditable artifacts.
rejected_alternatives:
  - alternative: Fully automatic release on merge
    reason: Higher risk of unintended publication and less operator control.
  - alternative: Entirely manual release steps without workflow automation
    reason: Repetitive, error-prone, and harder to audit.
