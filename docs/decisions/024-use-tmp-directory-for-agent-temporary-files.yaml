title: Use .tmp directory for agent temporary files
category: development
status: accepted
decision: >
  All AI agents use the .tmp/ directory at project root for temporary files,
  scratch work, and intermediate outputs. Agents do not use system temp paths
  or locations outside the repository root for temp artifacts.
agent_instructions: >
  Write temporary files (downloads, response dumps, generated scratch outputs,
  intermediate artifacts) to .tmp/ only. Create .tmp/ if missing.
  Do not use /tmp, %TEMP%, Desktop, or repository-tracked source directories.
  Clean up .tmp contents when no longer needed, but keep .tmp/.gitkeep.
rationale: >
  Project-local temp storage avoids sandbox and permission issues with system temp locations,
  keeps debugging artifacts discoverable, and prevents accidental commits via .gitignore.
