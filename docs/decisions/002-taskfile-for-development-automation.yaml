title: Taskfile for development automation
category: development
status: accepted
decision: >
  Use Taskfile as the primary interface for developer workflows including local stack management,
  validation, and test orchestration.
agent_instructions: >
  Prefer existing Taskfile tasks over ad-hoc shell commands.
  When adding recurring workflows, add or update a Taskfile task with clear naming and description.
rationale: >
  Task provides a discoverable, cross-platform command interface with dependency support and
  clear namespacing for project workflows.
rejected_alternatives:
  - alternative: Shell scripts only
    reason: Harder to discover, compose, and standardize across contributors.
  - alternative: Makefile as primary interface
    reason: Task offers clearer YAML syntax and easier workflow composition.
