title: CLI framework and command tree standard
category: architecture
status: accepted
decision: >
  Implement a structured command tree with groups auth, repo, pr, issue, and admin,
  following a gh-style UX for discoverability and consistency.
agent_instructions: >
  New commands must be added under one of the standard groups with shared flag semantics,
  predictable help text, and parity between human and JSON output modes.
  Avoid one-off top-level commands unless justified by a superseding decision.
rationale: >
  A stable command taxonomy reduces cognitive load and supports long-term automation compatibility.
  It also aligns implementation with the project migration and usability goals.
rejected_alternatives:
  - alternative: Flat command namespace
    reason: Harder discovery and increased risk of naming and behavior inconsistency.
