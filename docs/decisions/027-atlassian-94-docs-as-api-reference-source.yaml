title: Atlassian 9.4 docs as API reference source
category: architecture
status: accepted
decision: >
  Use Atlassian Bitbucket Data Center 9.4 REST documentation and its published OpenAPI
  artifact as the single external source of API reference for endpoint discovery, payload shape,
  and status-code expectations.
  Behavioral correctness is still determined by live server validation tests.
agent_instructions: >
  Use the version-pinned Atlassian 9.4 reference first when implementing or reviewing endpoints.
  Prefer the vendored OpenAPI artifact in docs/reference/atlassian for deterministic local access.
  Treat docs/spec as reference, not behavior truth; verify with live integration tests and encode
  mismatches as executable behavior tests.
rationale: >
  A single reference source reduces ambiguity and endpoint drift across implementations.
  At the same time, Bitbucket documentation can be incomplete or inconsistent in practice,
  so live validation remains mandatory for behavior-level confidence.
rejected_alternatives:
  - alternative: Use multiple unofficial sources for endpoint details
    reason: Increases inconsistency and implementation ambiguity.
  - alternative: Treat documentation/spec as behavior authority
    reason: Conflicts with observed real-server quirks and documented reliability concerns.
