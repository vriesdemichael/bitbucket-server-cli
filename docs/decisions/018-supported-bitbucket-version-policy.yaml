title: Supported Bitbucket version policy
category: architecture
status: accepted
decision: >
  Support Atlassian Bitbucket 9.4.16 as the primary compatibility target initially.
  Additional versions may be introduced through explicit decision updates and expanded live test coverage.
agent_instructions: >
  Assume 9.4.16 behavior as baseline unless a decision explicitly extends support.
  Version-specific handling must be documented and validated with live tests.
rationale: >
  Narrowing the initial compatibility surface enables faster delivery and stronger correctness.
  Controlled expansion avoids accidental multi-version support with unverified behavior.
rejected_alternatives:
  - alternative: Unbounded multi-version support from day one
    reason: Too broad for reliable behavior validation in early phases.
