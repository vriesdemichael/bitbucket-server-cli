title: Git discipline and branch management
category: development
status: accepted
decision: >
  Use strict git discipline: no direct commits to main, no merge or squash commits,
  conventional commits only, and rebase-based integration.
  History rewriting is permitted on PR branches but never on main.
agent_instructions: >
  Never commit directly to main. Work on PR branches from latest origin/main.
  Do not use merge commits or squash merges; use rebase-based merges.
  Keep commit messages conventional and meaningful for changelog generation.
  You may amend/rebase/force-with-lease on PR branches to clean history.
  Rebase PR branches on latest main before merge.
rationale: >
  Linear rebase-only history improves readability, bisectability, and release automation.
  Conventional commit discipline ensures changelog quality and predictable versioning behavior.
