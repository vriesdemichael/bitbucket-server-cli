title: Live test harness and deterministic seeding
category: development
status: accepted
decision: >
  Build a deterministic live integration harness using the local Bitbucket stack,
  seeded baseline entities, unique per-test namespaces where feasible, and repeatable cleanup/reset workflows.
agent_instructions: >
  Live tests must avoid hidden ordering dependencies.
  Prefer unique test resources and explicit teardown.
  When adding new domains, extend seeding/reset logic to keep tests reproducible.
rationale: >
  Deterministic setup is necessary for reliable live behavior validation and low maintenance overhead.
  It reduces flaky failures caused by shared mutable state.
rejected_alternatives:
  - alternative: Shared long-lived mutable test state
    reason: Increases flakiness and debugging cost.
