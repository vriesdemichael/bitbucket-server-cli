title: Go as primary implementation language
category: architecture
status: accepted
decision: >
  Implement the CLI and service client in Go as the primary runtime target.
  Do not retain Python runtime code in this repository.
agent_instructions: >
  For new implementation work, prefer Go packages and binaries over adding new Python runtime features.
  If parity with legacy behavior is needed, port behavior into Go and keep tests focused on server behavior.
rationale: >
  The project requires simple distribution as a standalone binary for local and CI usage.
  Go provides static binaries, predictable runtime behavior, and low operational friction.
rejected_alternatives:
  - alternative: Keep Python as primary implementation
    reason: Python requires runtime environment management and packaging complexity for standalone distribution.
