## Decision

Build a deterministic live integration harness using the local Bitbucket stack, seeded baseline entities, unique per-test namespaces where feasible, and repeatable cleanup/reset workflows.

## Agent Instructions

Live tests must avoid hidden ordering dependencies. Prefer unique test resources and explicit teardown. When adding new domains, extend seeding/reset logic to keep tests reproducible.

## Rationale

Deterministic setup is necessary for reliable live behavior validation and low maintenance overhead. It reduces flaky failures caused by shared mutable state.

## Rejected Alternatives

- `Shared long-lived mutable test state`: Increases flakiness and debugging cost.
