## Decision

Use Atlassian Bitbucket Data Center 9.4 REST documentation and its published OpenAPI artifact as the single external source of API reference for endpoint discovery, payload shape, and status-code expectations. Behavioral correctness is still determined by live server validation tests.

## Agent Instructions

Use the version-pinned Atlassian 9.4 reference first when implementing or reviewing endpoints. Prefer the vendored OpenAPI artifact in docs/reference/atlassian for deterministic local access. Treat docs/spec as reference, not behavior truth; verify with live integration tests and encode mismatches as executable behavior tests.

## Rationale

A single reference source reduces ambiguity and endpoint drift across implementations. At the same time, Bitbucket documentation can be incomplete or inconsistent in practice, so live validation remains mandatory for behavior-level confidence.

## Rejected Alternatives

- `Use multiple unofficial sources for endpoint details`: Increases inconsistency and implementation ambiguity.
- `Treat documentation/spec as behavior authority`: Conflicts with observed real-server quirks and documented reliability concerns.
