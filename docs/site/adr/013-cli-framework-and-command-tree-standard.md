## Decision

Implement a structured command tree with groups auth, repo, pr, issue, and admin, following a gh-style UX for discoverability and consistency.

## Agent Instructions

New commands must be added under one of the standard groups with shared flag semantics, predictable help text, and parity between human and JSON output modes. Avoid one-off top-level commands unless justified by a superseding decision.

## Rationale

A stable command taxonomy reduces cognitive load and supports long-term automation compatibility. It also aligns implementation with the project migration and usability goals.

## Rejected Alternatives

- `Flat command namespace`: Harder discovery and increased risk of naming and behavior inconsistency.
