## Decision

Introduce a dedicated top-level bb ai command group that houses all AI-first tooling. The initial subcommands are bb ai mcp (MCP server management) and bb ai skill (agent skill distribution). Each of these is itself a command group with further subcommands.

## Agent Instructions

All AI-agent-oriented features (MCP server, skill generation and installation) must live under bb ai. Do not add AI-specific concerns to existing groups such as auth, admin, or repo. Within bb ai, follow the same command-tree conventions established in ADR 013: grouped nouns, shared global flags, parity between human and JSON output modes.

## Rationale

Isolating AI tooling under a dedicated namespace keeps the main command tree focused on Bitbucket operations while making AI-first capabilities clearly discoverable. It also allows AI-specific concerns — host scoping, token capability restriction, skill versioning — to evolve independently without risk to existing command contracts. The name ai signals intent explicitly to both human users and coding agents reading bb --help.

## Rejected Alternatives

- `Add bb serve as a top-level command for the MCP server`: Pollutes the top-level namespace with infrastructure concerns; not parallel with the skill distribution need.
- `Add MCP server and skill commands under bb admin`: admin is scoped to Bitbucket server administration tasks, not local CLI tooling. Wrong semantic bucket.
- `Add MCP server and skill commands under bb auth`: auth manages credentials, not tooling distribution. Conflation would confuse both humans and agents.
