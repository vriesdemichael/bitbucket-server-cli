## Decision

Treat undocumented or surprising Bitbucket behavior as first-class compatibility knowledge by encoding each finding as an explicit live test with a descriptive name and rationale.

## Agent Instructions

When discovering quirks, add or update a targeted live test and include a concise explanation in test naming or adjacent documentation. Do not rely on memory or ad-hoc notes for behavior exceptions.

## Rationale

Executable behavior knowledge prevents regressions and creates durable project memory. It is especially important for APIs with inconsistent documentation quality.

## Rejected Alternatives

- `Track quirks only in prose docs`: Not enforceable and prone to drift.
