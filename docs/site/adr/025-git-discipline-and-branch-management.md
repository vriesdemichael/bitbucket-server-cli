## Decision

Use strict git discipline: no direct commits to main, no merge or squash commits, conventional commits only, and rebase-based integration. History rewriting is permitted on PR branches but never on main.

## Agent Instructions

Never commit directly to main. Work on PR branches from latest origin/main. Do not use merge commits or squash merges; use rebase-based merges. Keep commit messages conventional and meaningful for changelog generation. You may amend/rebase/force-with-lease on PR branches to clean history. Rebase PR branches on latest main before merge.

## Rationale

Linear rebase-only history improves readability, bisectability, and release automation. Conventional commit discipline ensures changelog quality and predictable versioning behavior.
