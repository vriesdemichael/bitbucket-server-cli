## Decision

Use typed Go structs with explicit runtime validation rules for inputs and configuration, and support JSON schema export for machine validation of JSON/YAML examples and docs.

## Agent Instructions

Define validation close to model definitions and validate at boundaries (config load, request payload construction, and external input parsing). Keep schemas generated from the model source of truth rather than hand-maintained files.

## Rationale

This preserves core benefits previously achieved with Pydantic: strict data validation, explicit contracts, and schema-driven validation for documentation examples.

## Rejected Alternatives

- `Validation only in business logic`: Error-prone and inconsistent, with weaker contract guarantees.
- `Handwritten schemas detached from model types`: High drift risk and duplicate maintenance burden.
