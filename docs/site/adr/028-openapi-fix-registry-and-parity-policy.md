## Decision

Maintain a dedicated YAML registry at docs/openapi/fixes.yaml for every workaround, sanitizer rule, post-generation fix, or runtime/test adaptation needed on top of Atlassian's vendored OpenAPI artifact to produce usable generated models/endpoints. Each registry entry must include description, reference, detailed change notes, and executable verification commands. OpenAPI-derived behavior is considered trustworthy only when covered by seeded live parity tests that exercise non-empty flows.

## Agent Instructions

Whenever you add or modify any OpenAPI-related fix (spec sanitation, generation patch, adapter behavior, or compatibility test), update docs/openapi/fixes.yaml in the same change. Do not rely on empty-list parity tests for contract confidence; prefer seeded live tests that create and verify real entities. If a fix is removed because upstream spec/tooling improved, remove or update the registry entry and include verification evidence in the change.

## Rationale

Generated code depends on both upstream spec quality and generator behavior. Without explicit fix logging, compatibility knowledge becomes tribal and regressions are hard to diagnose. A structured fix registry plus seeded parity tests creates an auditable trail and a repeatable trust model for future endpoint expansion.

## Rejected Alternatives

- `Keep OpenAPI fixes only in commit history`: Hard to discover, weak for onboarding, and poor at enforcing ongoing hygiene.
- `Treat generated output as self-documenting`: Generated code shows final state but not why deviations or sanitizers were needed.
- `Use parity tests without data seeding`: Empty-state checks can pass while failing to prove real contract behavior.
