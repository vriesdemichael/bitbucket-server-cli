## Decision

Provide consistent human-readable output by default and a stable machine mode via --json. JSON responses must use versioned envelopes for forward-compatible parsing.

## Agent Instructions

Keep display formatting separated from domain/workflow logic. Ensure every data-returning command supports --json and stable field naming. Changes to JSON contracts require explicit versioning and migration notes.

## Rationale

The CLI must serve both interactive operators and automation scripts without ambiguity. Stable machine contracts reduce breaking changes and improve integration reliability.

## Rejected Alternatives

- `Human output only`: Not sufficient for automation and CI/local scripting workflows.
- `Unversioned JSON payloads`: Harder to evolve safely over time.
