## Decision

Support Atlassian Bitbucket 9.4.16 as the primary compatibility target initially. Additional versions may be introduced through explicit decision updates and expanded live test coverage.

## Agent Instructions

Assume 9.4.16 behavior as baseline unless a decision explicitly extends support. Version-specific handling must be documented and validated with live tests.

## Rationale

Narrowing the initial compatibility surface enables faster delivery and stronger correctness. Controlled expansion avoids accidental multi-version support with unverified behavior.

## Rejected Alternatives

- `Unbounded multi-version support from day one`: Too broad for reliable behavior validation in early phases.
