# Machine Mode and Diagnostics

## Machine mode contract

Use global `--json` for machine-consumable output.

Envelope shape:

<!-- docs-lint: envelope-shape -->
```json
{
  "data": {},
  "meta": {
    "bbVersion": "[[ bb_version_tag ]]"
  }
}
```

`data` holds command-specific payloads. `meta.bbVersion` reports which binary produced the
document -- provenance for stored output, not a compatibility switch.

There is no contract version. Adding a field to `data` is additive; removing or renaming one,
changing its type, or changing whether it can be null is a breaking change that cuts a new
major release ([ADR-064](../adr/064-machine-output-carries-no-contract-version.md)). Pin the
binary version to pin the contract.

### Failure envelope

When a command fails while `--json` is set, stdout carries an `error` object where `data` would be:

<!-- docs-lint: envelope-shape -->
```json
{
  "error": {
    "kind": "validation",
    "message": "no Bitbucket host configured: set BITBUCKET_URL or run 'bb auth login <host>'",
    "exitCode": 2
  },
  "meta": {
    "bbVersion": "[[ bb_version_tag ]]"
  }
}
```

**Which key is present tells you the outcome:** `data` on success, `error` on failure. Never both. This stays unambiguous for a command whose successful `data` is legitimately `null`.

`kind` and `exitCode` come from the taxonomy below, so you can branch on either without parsing `message`. `exitCode` always matches the process exit status.

The human-readable line still goes to stderr, exactly as it does without `--json`.

This applies to usage errors too — an unknown flag or command produces an envelope, not just a bare string:

<!-- docs-lint: expect-invalid -->
```bash
bb --json repo list --nonexistent-flag
```

The failure envelope has the same shape for every command, so there is one schema for it rather
than one per command.

## Diagnostics behavior

- Diagnostics are emitted to `stderr` to preserve `stdout` contracts.
- Use `--log-format jsonl` for machine-filterable diagnostics.
- Use `--log-level` to tune verbosity (`error`, `warn`, `info`, `debug`).
- Sensitive values are redacted from diagnostic output.

Example:

```bash
bb --json --log-level warn --log-format jsonl auth status 2> diagnostics.jsonl
```

## Recommended scripting pattern

1. Use `--json` and parse only the `data` payload needed for automation.
2. Branch on the `error` key, or on the exit code, before reading `data`.
3. Keep diagnostics in separate stderr capture.
4. Validate bulk artifacts against published schemas when integrating with CI.

```bash
if output=$(bb --json pr get 42 2>/dev/null); then
  echo "$output" | jq -r '.data.title'
else
  echo "$output" | jq -r '"\(.error.kind): \(.error.message)"'
fi
```

## Error kinds and exit codes

Command failures use deterministic exit codes by error kind.

- `validation` -> exit code `2` (includes unknown flags and commands)
- `authentication` or `authorization` -> exit code `3`
- `not_found` -> exit code `4`
- `conflict` -> exit code `5`
- `transient` -> exit code `10`
- `not_implemented` -> exit code `11`
- `cancelled` -> exit code `12` (interrupted; not something to retry automatically)
- `unknown_outcome` -> exit code `13` (the request was sent and its result never came back)
- `permanent` and `internal` (or unknown) -> exit code `1`

`unknown_outcome` is the one worth wiring into a script deliberately. It means bb
cannot say whether the server applied the request -- a mutation that timed out, for
instance. Retrying it may repeat work that already happened, so the answer is to
check the state and then decide. That is why it sits outside `transient`, which is
the code a retry loop should key on.

### Handles on the failure envelope

A failure may carry an optional `error.details` object: a flat map of strings naming what you
need to act on it. It is absent when there is nothing to carry.

`bb bulk apply` sets `operationId` there, because on the failure path the error envelope is
the only document written (ADR-075) and the status artifact is reached by id:

```bash
operationId=$(bb bulk apply --from-plan plan.json --json | jq -r '.error.details.operationId // empty')
bb bulk status "$operationId" --json
```

Read handles from `error.details`, not by parsing `error.message`.

#### Changed in v4: `bb bulk apply --json` on the failure path

Through v3, a `bb bulk apply --json` run that failed printed **two** documents: the status
envelope, then the failure envelope. A strict JSON parser rejects that outright; `jq` reads a
value stream, so it prints a result per document and exits `0` — meaning a pipeline that took
the last line silently read the wrong one.

From v4 a failing or cancelled run writes only the failure envelope, so `.data` is absent.
Scripts that read the artifact from `bb bulk apply` output must fetch it by id instead:

```bash
# Through v3 — no longer returns the artifact
bb bulk apply --from-plan plan.json --json | jq -r '.data.summary.failedTargets'

# v4
output=$(bb bulk apply --from-plan plan.json --json) || true
operationId=$(printf '%s' "$output" | jq -r '.error.details.operationId // empty')
bb bulk status "$operationId" --json | jq -r '.data.summary.failedTargets'
```

Human output is unchanged: the status still goes to stdout and the error line to stderr.

Example failure behavior:

```bash
bb tag list --repo BADFORMAT
echo $?
```

```text
validation: --repo must be in PROJECT/slug format
2
```

Under `--json`, the same failure additionally produces the envelope shown above on stdout.

### Malformed invocations

An unknown flag, unknown command, bad flag value or wrong argument count is the caller's mistake,
and reports `validation` with exit code `2` — the same as any other input the CLI rejects:

<!-- docs-lint: expect-invalid -->
```bash
bb --json repo list --nonexistent-flag
```

<!-- docs-lint: envelope-shape -->
```json
{
  "error": {
    "kind": "validation",
    "message": "unknown flag: --nonexistent-flag",
    "exitCode": 2
  },
  "meta": { "bbVersion": "[[ bb_version_tag ]]" }
}
```

This matters for automation: `internal` means *the CLI broke*, and a caller that retries or
escalates on it would do the wrong thing with its own typo. Genuine failures — a refused
connection, an unexpected server response — still report `internal` and exit `1`.
