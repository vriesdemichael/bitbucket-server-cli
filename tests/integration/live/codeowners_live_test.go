// CODEOWNERS against a real Bitbucket.
//
// The whole feature reads one file out of the repository, matches it against a
// pull request's diff, and resolves what it finds into reviewers. Every one of
// those inputs -- the file, the diff, the reviewer groups, the users -- used to
// be supplied by a handwritten server, which is to say the tests chose the
// answers they then checked. The syntax is wide enough that this matters:
// anchoring, globbing, escaped spaces and the two kinds of at-sign all read
// alike and behave differently, and the reviewer-group form has already been
// wrong once in a way no mock noticed (#503).
